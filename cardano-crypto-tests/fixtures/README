Test fixtures
=============

These fixtures all follow the same format: hex-encoded byte arrays
(representing keys, messages, or digests), separated by colons (:), one set
per line.

Data is sourced differently for each algorithm, depending on availability:

- BLAKE2b (blake2b_224.input, blake2b_256.input)
  Messages were generated by taking bytes from `/dev/urandom` on a Debian
  GNU/Linux system, and then hashed with the b2sum utility from
  https://github.com/BLAKE2/BLAKE2

- ED25519 (ed25519.input)
  Test data was taken directly from the reference implementation's test set at
  https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/python/sign.input

- MD5 (md5.input)
  Messages were generated by taking bytes from `/dev/urandom` on a Debian
  GNU/Linux system, and then hashed using the `md5sum` utility provided by the
  OS.

- SHA256 (sha256.input)
  Messages were generated by taking bytes from `/dev/urandom` on a Debian
  GNU/Linux system, and then hashed using the `sha256sum` utility provided by
  the OS.
